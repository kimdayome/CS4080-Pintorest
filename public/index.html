Note for Jessica <3

* index.html and index.js run first (entry point), this is principal and won't change
* when the index.js runs, it tells the react to render the app components to inject into the 'root'
* so in the index.js, 'ReactDOM.render() is the component you want to render. in that case, the components under that one are child components.'
* so the flow is index.js & index.html -> App.js -> the compoents injected in 'root', which is inside index.html
